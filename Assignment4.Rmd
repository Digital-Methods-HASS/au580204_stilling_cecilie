1) Use R to figure out how many elements in the vector below are greater than 2.
```{r}
rooms <- c(1, 2, 1, 3, 1, NA, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, NA, 1, 8, 3, 1, 4, NA, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 7, 1, NA)

sum(rooms > 2, na.rm = T)
#there are 8 elements in the vector that are greater than 2

```

2) What type of data is in the 'rooms' vector?

```{r}
class(rooms)
#the data is numeric
```
